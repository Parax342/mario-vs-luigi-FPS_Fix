# FPS FIX
This mod should fix the issue with NSMB Mario vs Luigi where your fps keeps becoming unlimited
It also allows you to decrease the fps of the game to a configurable value while it isn't in focus

This is not official or affiliated with the creator of nsmb mario vs luigi in any way

ALSO i dont know what im doing, im pretty sure if you download the source you have to add all the .dll files in the visual studio project manually idk really
